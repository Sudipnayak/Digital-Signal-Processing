# Digital-Signal-Processing

In this, I focused on digital signal processing (DSP) techniques , designed and implemented different types of digital filters, such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop filters, using MATLAB's signal processing toolbox, analyzed the frequency response, magnitude and phase characteristics, and filter performance metrics. I also explored advanced topics like filter design optimization and adaptive filtering. 

I worked with speech signals and applied various DSP techniques using, implemented algorithms for speech signal processing tasks, such as speech enhancement, speech recognition, and speech synthesis. I explored techniques like windowing, Fourier analysis, linear prediction analysis, and cepstral analysis. MATLAB's signal processing toolbox and audio processing functions were utilized to process and analyze speech signals. This project provided hands-on experience in speech signal processing using MATLAB.

This involved applying DSP techniques to image processing and restoration tasks using MATLAB. I implemented algorithms for image filtering, such as noise removal using filters like median filter, Wiener filter, and adaptive filters. I explored techniques for image enhancement and restoration, including histogram equalization, contrast stretching, and image denoising. MATLAB's image processing toolbox was utilized to perform various operations on images, such as filtering, convolution, and spatial domain processing. This project provided practical exposure to image processing techniques using MATLAB.

 Learned Spectral analysis of signals, implemented algorithms for computing the Fourier transform, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and fast Fourier transform (FFT). I applied windowing techniques, such as Hamming and Blackman windows, to mitigate spectral leakage. I visualized and analyzed frequency spectra, power spectra, and spectrograms using MATLAB's signal processing functions and plotting capabilities. This project deepened my understanding of spectral analysis and the Fourier transform in MATLAB.

AND MANY MORE.

All these highlight my expertise in digital signal processing techniques using MATLAB. They demonstrate my ability to design and implement DSP algorithms for applications such as filter design, speech signal processing, image processing, spectral analysis, etc.
